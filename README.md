# RecSys
Recommendation systems projects
1. RecSys_RNN:
   Given a sequence of click events performed by some user during a typical session in an e-commerce website, the goal is to predict 
   whether the user is going to buy something or not, and if he is buying, what would be the items he is going to buy.
   The dataset is available at : https://2015.recsyschallenge.com/challenge.html
   
2. Goodreads book recommendation:
    Goodreads 10k dataset contains ratings for ten thousand popular books found on the internet. In this dataset there are 100 reviews for
    each book, although some have less - fewer - ratings. Ratings are given from 1 to 5. 
    The main goal of this project is to suggest new books to the user that may interest them to increase the user engagement.
