1. RecSys_RNN:
   Given a sequence of click events performed by some user during a typical session in an e-commerce website, the goal is to predict 
   whether the user is going to buy something or not, and if he is buying, what would be the items he is going to buy.
   The dataset is available at : https://2015.recsyschallenge.com/challenge.html
